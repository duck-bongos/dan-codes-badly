Source code for [dan-codes-badly.com](https://dan-codes-badly.com). This was my second project using Rust and my first building a website! Any advice on how to structure the website better is welcome! The title is tongue-in-cheek since - it amused me.

### Protein Comparison Tool
I've recently started to take my nutrition a lot more seriously, which includes protein intake. I get overwhelmed looking at the protein bar aisle in my grocery store, comparing each one based on leanness and price, then comparing those to non-protein bar options like vegan or animal sources of protein. It's a lot of math and numbers to remember - so I stopped and I outsourced it to an online version of myself.

You: "_If you wanted to use this on your phone, why didn't you make it into a Smart Phone App?_"

Me: I heard stories about the rigor required to go through the Google Play and Apple App Stores. I don't need all that. This isn't something I'm looking to do professionally (at the moment), therefore the ROI is low for me at the moment.
